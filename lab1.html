     <p> This is a short paragraph to demonstrate my ablility to write paragraphs.  My favorite type of paragraph contains an engaging first sentence, a solid body made up fo anywhere
       from 3-7 sentences, and a concises summary. My tendency is to use paragraphs both, written and verbaly, to get my points across. When brevity is needed, however, I will substatue 
       paragraphs for shorter phrases.
